# How to be resilient to emotional abuse?

You got out of an abusive relationship, maybe you're still in one, or maybe you're wondering if you might be missing something in communication. What now?

1. Look for healthy and unhealthy mindsets
2. Address gaslighting by separating your point of view
3. Notice what happens if you disagree
4. Look for labels and whether you accept them or not
