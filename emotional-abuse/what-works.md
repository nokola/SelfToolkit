# what works

* The attachment I have to his positive feedback and learning how to recognize that as part of the abusive system/cycle.
* Trying to "fix" people's emotions is doing them a disservice
* Modify your behavior to get your needs met is different than modifying your behavior to appease someone else. "Okay, I hope you put the little part about modifying your behavior in an effort to actually get your needs met - needs for understanding, connection, etc. is different than modifying your behavior to appease someone else. I keep thinking about that and I feel pretty empowered by it. I like that I'm a flexible enough and creative enough person that I can problem solve around communication. I have patience and interest to do that work." "However I'm adjusting my behavior because I choose to express myself in a way folks understand better rather than gain their approval"
