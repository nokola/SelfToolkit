# Improving wellbeing from abuse

TL; DR; focus on self-care and self-worth.

Likely "environment" will be the biggest contributor to improving wellbeing. Being in an environment where you're supported and not called names, your feelings and needs are respected and matter would make wonders for improving the situation.

You can create such environment by a) leaving or b) if you stay, surround yourself with people and experiences who lift you up. If you have positive experiences, the "at home" experience will affect you less.

a) boundaries (the prompts above were mostly boundary-related)

b) enmeshment (when one person's opinion stops and the other person's starts - such as "who defines "bad"?)

c) connecting with your feelings and needs (short list here: https://www.sociocracyforall.org/nvc-feelings-and-needs-list/) by thinking "how do I feel" and "what do I need" on a regular basis - multiple times a day

d) understanding how to effectively communicate requests without labelling. Such as "I want to go out for some time, and will be back in few hours" (clear) rather than "please give me space" (unclear)



All of those will be steps towards improved wellbeing and help with coping and thriving strategies. It can take months or years and the progress is non-linear.
