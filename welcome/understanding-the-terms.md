# Understanding the terms

Terms are crucial here because I define some words differently than "common knowledge."

For example, I define emotions and feelings to mean very specific, different things in the context of this toolkit. This doesn't mean that my definition is correct and another incorrect. It just means I'm going to use these definitions to help me make myself clearer.&#x20;

Most people skim through terms and definitions.&#x20;

If you do, you run the risk of misunderstanding the content, have it work differently or fail.

My mother, a teacher of more than 40 years says: "People really understand a subject almost all by themselves when they understood the terminology deeply. Not just a short sentence of what a term means, but practice with examples, use it, understand where and how the term applies and the dangers of applying it."

Terms are indicated by text "Term:" in titles.
