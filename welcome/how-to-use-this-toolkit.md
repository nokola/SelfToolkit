# How to use this toolkit

1. Start by reviewing the first couple of chapters: Principles, Mindsets, Paradigm/Shift, and Learn a new language.
2. Continue with any chapter depending on your interests.
3. When you find a tool that resonates, use it at work or at home. Some tools relate to self-reflection and thought. I find those most useful since they enabled me to improve my wellbeing just by myself without the help of others. They also tend to work faster for me.

Tools in this toolkit are marked with the ðŸ›  icon in headings and in the content.
