# "The Work" by Byron Katie

a way of getting "a part" to understand the other parts to reduce fight/flight response



```
Is it true?
Can you absolutely know that itâ€™s true?
How do you react when you believe that thought?
Who would you be without the thought?
```

Turnaround: generating options such as "what if the opposite is true" or "what if I did X" (to contribute to the problem), them coming up with examples



TODO: interesting re: `turnaround` can become part of Mutual Learning Model.

`turnaround` can be used as the first two options in Generate Options:

1. The opposite is true
2. I'm doing what I'm thinking others are doing
3. Some combination of the above is true
4. Something else

Dangers:

1. Believing that only the opposite is true
2. It's possible that what you say is true - this exercise is to help move on past flight/fight response and into integrated understanding (IFS-like)



Lots of commonalities with CBT:



_**Investigative and transforming questions**_\
\
_Questions to investigation and analysis of the problem-situation_

* &#x20;What happened in the situation? (who said/did what, when?)
* What did you feel then? How were you? (how angry/sad etc. were you on a scale 0-10?

\
_Questions to transforming and restructuring the central thought_

* How convinced are you, that this thought is true?&#x20;

\
Argumentation

* What do you base the thought on? What substance do you have for it? What is the evidence for it?
* Is there anything in the situation, which can point in another direction?

\
Alternatives

* Could you think different in this situation? (More self-supporting and constructive?)
* What would a more realistic/self-supporting way to think be in this situation?

\
Worst and best

* What would the worst be, if your thought is true?
* Would it be so bad?

\
Problem-solution

* If your interpretation/thought is true, what could you then do in order to manage the situation better?
* Could you lay a plan, so the situation is getting better now/onwards?

\
Distancing

* What would you tell your best friend, if he, in the same situation, was thinking in that way?
* How would you perceive the situation in three months/six months?
