# "The Work" by Byron Katie

a way of getting "a part" to understand the other parts to reduce fight/flight response



```
Is it true?
Can you absolutely know that itâ€™s true?
How do you react when you believe that thought?
Who would you be without the thought?
```

Turnaround: generating options such as "what if the opposite is true" or "what if I did X" (to contribute to the problem), them coming up with examples



TODO: interesting re: `turnaround` can become part of Mutual Learning Model.
