# The Abusive Mindsets

1. “An argument should only last as long as my patience does. Once I’ve had enough, the discussion is over and it’s time for you to shut up.”&#x20;
2. “If the issue we’re struggling over is important to me, I should get what I want. If you don’t back off, you’re wronging me.”&#x20;
3. “I know what is best for you and for our relationship. If you continue disagreeing with me after I’ve made it clear which path is the right one, you’re acting stupid.”&#x20;
4. “If my control and authority seem to be slipping, I have the right to take steps to reestablish the rule of my will, including abuse if necessary.”
