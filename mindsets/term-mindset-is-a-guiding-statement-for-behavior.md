# Term: "Mindset": is a guiding statement for behavior

* There are multiple mindsets - hundreds if not thousands
* We switch through them all the time
* They are fundamental to our behavior
* Mindsets will help us or prevent us from noticing information
* Other people likely have a different set of mindsets, thus they will notice different information than us
  * That's how disagreements arise
