# Term: "Triggers", or how to pause?

Trigger: anything outside or inside of us that ends up contributing to a specific emotion or feeling.

Also known as stimulus.

## How to start noticing more of our triggers to expand our thinking gap?

1. **Look for patterns.** e.g. are you usually upset on Saturday? or when hungry? When are you happy? e.g. on the couch, on the table, outside. Is there any specific time or occasion that consistently results in a given emotion?
2. **Tell yourself** "Next time I see \<pattern> I will notice it"
3. When you notice the pattern, **identify the feeling and tell yourself** [this-is-me-being-x.md](../self-awareness/this-is-me-being-x.md "mention")

Other ways:

1. When speaking, pause for 5 seconds intentionally somewhere. Try to pause more and more
2. Sometimes pause for 10 seconds
3. Use [check-and-choice.md](../learn-a-new-language/check-and-choice.md "mention") and any of the other tools here.&#x20;
