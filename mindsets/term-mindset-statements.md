# Term: "Mindset statements"

Use mindset statements to help realize and set your _conscious_ mind in a way that will help you achieve peace, joy, and pleasant outcomes.

Mindset statements are:

1. A simple statement, such as "I am better than him", "I know how to cook", or "Different opinions are useful"
2. Usually, subconscious
3. We hold minimum 5 of them without realizing in any situation.

And more:

* There are multiple mindsets - hundreds if not thousands
* We switch through them all the time
* They are fundamental to our behavior
* Mindsets will **help us or prevent** us from noticing information
* Other people likely have a different set of mindsets, thus they will notice different information than us. That's part of how disagreements arise

## Adopting a mindset

In my experience, a mindset is adopted when I can remember the mindset statement more than 5% of the time.

I have not found a good way to adopt mindsets yet, however here are a few that have worked to some extent for me and others:

1. Come up with a mindset statement and think about it before a situation (conversation, meeting)
2. Write mindset statements that you'd like to adopt on notes and spread them around the desk/room/bedroom/etc.
3. Use them as phone or computer background.
