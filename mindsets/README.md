# Mindsets

Before we do anything, we _always_ have a specific state of mind and predisposition towards it. Those are mindsets.

Mindsets guide our behavior and determine in large part our outcomes.

**Mindsets are typically subconscious. It's important to make mindsets conscious.**

They are the most important part of communication since they can derail us from clarity of message - if we keep them subconscious - or help us achieve clarity of message if we realize them consciously.

I may be proficient with all kinds of talking and communication tools, however if my mindset can be summarized as "I know better" I will use (often subconsciously) my tools to squash others' ideas and get my way. I will miss information and clarity. On the other side if I have a mindset of curiosity e.g. "I have information and so do others" I will be more involved in the discussion and make it more pleasant and inclusive for everyone, regardless of what talking tools or skills I have.

If I think about others' mindsets I can check them by asking clarifying questions.

How do we set our mind? Using mindset statements.
