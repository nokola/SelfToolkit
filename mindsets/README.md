# Mindsets

Before we do anything, we _always_ have a specific state of mind and predisposition towards it. Those are mindsets.

Mindsets guide our behavior and determine in large part our outcomes.

**Mindsets are typically subconscious. It's important to make mindsets conscious.**

They are the most important part of communication since they can derail us from clarity of message - if we keep them subconscious - or help us achieve clarity of message if we realize them consciously.

## Why care about mindsets?

Mindsets can literally make or break communication, understanding, and connection. They influence outcomes before anything else, like talking tools, skills, and charisma.

Mindsets influence how clear we are to ourselves and others and can contribute or prevent self-sabotage, regardless of our skills.

<summary>Example</summary>

I may be proficient with all kinds of communication tools, however if my mindset can be summarized as "I know better" I will use - often subconsciously - my tools to squash others' ideas and get my way. I will miss information and clarity.&#x20;

On the other side if I have a mindset of curiosity e.g. "I have information and so do others" I will be more involved in the discussion and make it more pleasant and inclusive for everyone, regardless of what talking tools or skills I have.
