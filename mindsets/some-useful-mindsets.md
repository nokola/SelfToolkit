# Some Useful Mindsets

There are a couple of mindsets that are so useful, they are worth sharing and adopting as soon as possible. Part of those are from [mutual-learning-model.md](../references/mutual-learning-model.md "mention") and other sources in my studies.

Pick one mindset and think about it over the next week before meetings and conversations. Come back and pick a new one every week:

1. "I have information and so do others"
2. "People can disagree with me and have pure intent"
3. People can only say "please" and "thank you"
4. "Unexpected outcomes may be OK"

Danger: beware of these mindsets that are harmful:

1. "I know better" - makes it less likely to ask questions. As in, less likely to be curious
2. "They know better" - makes it less likely to speak up and share in your ideas.
3. "People are out to get me" - might be true, might be false
