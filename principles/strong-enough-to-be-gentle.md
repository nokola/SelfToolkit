# ⚒ Strong enough to be gentle

What does it mean to be mentally strong?

Here is a part of an interview where Peter Cullen, the voice of Optimus Prime in the Transformers movie discusses mental strength. He heard it from his brother, a marine:

“If you’re going to be a hero Peter, be a real hero. … There was a seriousness in him. The way he talked…there was a smoothness in it.”&#x20;

“Be strong enough to be gentle. Be compassionate.”

Similar to [clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind.md](clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind.md "mention") the Strong Enough to be Gentle concept has two aspects:

1. **Self:** Are you strong enough to be gentle to yourself? Do you enjoy what life has to offer? Is your self-talk (internal thinking) lifting yourself up or putting yourself down? Sometimes, people say things to themselves that they would never say to others, like "I'm not good enough" "I'm a failure" or "I suck". Would you say what you tell yourself to a friend?&#x20;
2. **Others:** When you get in any situation, think: am I strong enough to be gentle? What does it look like?

Another way to think about it - imagine you're playing with a puppy. The puppy is cute, small, cuddly, and excited. It runs all over the place, jumps around and wags at you. You are much stronger than the puppy, but you pick them gently, you play with them slowly and both enjoy the process.

Imagine if you can extend the same gentleness, calm, and clarity of mind to yourself in situations that are stressful. Imagine if you can do it when others are stressed or upset. That's strong enough to be gentle.

For me - super hard to achieve, for now.
