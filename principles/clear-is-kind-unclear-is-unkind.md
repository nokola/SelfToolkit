# Clear is kind, unclear is unkind

Communication is really just one thing: **clarity of message**.

Don't worry about judgement. Look for clarity of message

Don't worry about character. Clarity of message.

When you're ashamed, upset, happy, or any other feeling. Look for clarity.

...

and so on.

What is clarity? It boils down to two things:

1. Are people understanding what I mean?
2. Am I understanding what others mean?

Note the above text doesn't say "Am I being clear?".&#x20;

**You can only be clear if the other side understands you.**

Often times people argue "I said X. It's obvious! I'm clear". Think about this: who decides if you're clear? You or the person receiving the message? If someone seems to not understand, are you clear enough?

Maybe. Even so: I like to define me being clear as only one thing: the other person can understand me. It helps me seek and attempt to provide clarity. The other implication "there's something wrong with them" does not help me.

The concept of clarity of message is so fundamental that Bren√© Brown, a famous researcher on connection, links it to kindness: Clear is kind, unclear is unkind.

There are two aspects to "clear is kind":

1. Self: Are you kind to yourself? For example, if you feel ashamed do you seek internal clarity of message? Do you look for what your feeling is indicating?
2. Others: Are you kind to others? If someone does not understand you or is upset, do you seek clarity? Do you try to provide clarity?
