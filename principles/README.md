# Principles

Also called **predispositions**, **aspirational goals**, **motivations,** **attitudes,** or **beliefs.**

This toolkit follows three principles that I find foundational and pre-requisite as a state of mind to make the most out of life.

Try to keep them in mind as often as you can.

It's Ok to forget about a principle from time to time. No shame.
