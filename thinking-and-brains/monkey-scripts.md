# Monkey scripts

Alex: Where do you want to go for lunch?

Bo: I'm not sure, you?

Alex: I'm OK with anything. How about you pick?

Bo: Mexican?

Alex: Sounds good.

What we just saw above is an example of Monkey script - automatic social glue, subconsciously driven by Monkey brain. If examined, some scripts are useful, while others are not. Think patterns of abusive behavior or enabling abusive behavior.

Driving is a Lizard script. It's not a social activity in the sense how chatting with friends or evaluating something is. Evaluations during driving of other people's competency are social, Monkey brain activities. If they happen consistently, they are probably a Monkey script.

Realizing **consciously** whether you are running on a script can improve your wellbeing. It will provide you with the ability to engage your Human brain and options to choose what to do - rather than Monkey making a subconscious choice.
