# "Being aware" means to understand our momentous internal state

My definition of being aware is literally: Use my human brain in the thinking gap.

Our internal state consists of feelings, needs, triggered by external events or by internal events (e.g. I'm hungry right now).

Feelings and needs can chage every second and moment to moment.

**Self-awareness:** Having the awareness of what my feelings and needs are **now.** Specifically useful in the thinking gap before I respond.

**Other-awareness:** Having the ability to engage my Human brain in the thinking gap to analyze the current situation and guess what might be happening.
