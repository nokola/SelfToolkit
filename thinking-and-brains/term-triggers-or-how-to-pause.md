# Term: "Trigger" or "Stimulus"

Trigger or stimulus: anything outside or inside of us that ends up contributing to a specific emotion or feeling

## How to start noticing more of our triggers to expand our thinking space?

1. **Look for patterns.** e.g. are you usually upset on Saturday? or when hungry? When are you happy? For example: on the couch, on the table, outside. Is there any specific time, situation, or person where you consistently feel a certain way around?
2. **Tell yourself** "Next time I see \<pattern> I will notice it"
3. When you notice the pattern, **identify the feeling and tell yourself** [this-is-me-being-x.md](../self-awareness/this-is-me-being-x.md "mention")**.** This can help stop the feeling to escalate and may help expand your thinking space for the Human brain to analyze.

Other ways:

1. When speaking, pause for 5 or 10 seconds intentionally somewhere.
2. Use [check-and-choice.md](../learn-a-new-language/check-and-choice.md "mention")
3. Use any of the other tools.&#x20;
