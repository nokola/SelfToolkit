# Conscious space

How do we think and respond to situations?

Here's a simplified overview of how we process things:

1. **Stimulus**: something happens around us. e.g. someone says or does something
2. **Reaction**: our monkey brain (sometimes the Lizard too) create a feeling
3. **Conscious space:** Any time from non-existent to however long we like. The Human brain may take over and process in during this time. 95% of the cases, the Human brain will stay out of the way. Instead, we get a Monkey brain response.
4. **Response:** what comes out of our mouth, the things we do, if anything.

The goal of effective _conscious_ communication is to train ourselves to expand the conscious space. The more time we have in the conscious space, the more opportunities we have to:

1. Interpret the stimulus in different viewpoints.
2. Examine our reaction.
3. **Produce strategies** to respond to get what we want: decide how and if to meet our needs and needs of others.

**In short: expand the time available for Human brain to contribute. Then, engage the Human brain in conscious thought.**

Once we are "in the conscious space", we have the option to employ many of the tools in this toolkit.
