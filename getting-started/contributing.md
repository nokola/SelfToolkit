This toolkit is a continuous work in progress, with content being updated, changed, and moved often based on feedback.

I ask that you send feedback on anything not working or working. Write a lot, write details, and use [observations](../learn-a-new-language/term-observation-is-something-we-can-record-on-camera-or-microphone-or-notice-of-ourselves.md).&#x20;
