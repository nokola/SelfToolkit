# How to use this toolkit

This toolkit uses very specific **terms** (or "words") that are defined, sometimes very differently, then you might have heard and known. Read carefully through the definition of terms - it will help convey the meaning of the tools better. Otherwise, you run the risk of misunderstand, misusing, or just thinking of a tool as not effective.

To use the tools read the first couple of chapters introducing terminology and the importance of mindsets. Then:

1. Understand the terms - this is 80% of more of being able to understand a tool
2. Understand the tool (e.g. "mindset" statements)
3. Use part of the tool for a week or so
