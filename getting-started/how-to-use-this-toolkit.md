This toolkit uses very specific **terms** (or "words") that are defined, sometimes very differently than "common knowledge." Read carefully through the definition of terms - it will help convey the meaning of the tools better. Otherwise, you run the risk of misunderstand, misusing, or just thinking of a tool as not effective.
