# What is this toolkit?

This is a collection of tools made by various individuals to help with:

1. ...understanding yourself and others
2. ...improve communication and connection&#x20;
3. ...wellbeing

These tools have been developed, collected, and reinterpreted by different people, some like you. I hope the tools here will help others and we can expand it to contain structured knowledge about improving awareness and communication at scale.
