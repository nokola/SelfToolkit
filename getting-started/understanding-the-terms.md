# Understanding the terms

Most people skim through terms and definitions.&#x20;

Don't.

Please don't.

If you do, you run the risk of misunderstanding the content, have it work differently or fail.

My mother, a teacher for the last 40 years says: "People really understand \<a subject> almost all by themselves when they have deep understanding of the terminology. Not just a short sentence of what a term means, but practice with examples, use the term, understand where and how the term applies and the gotchas."

The beginning of this toolkit will start with some terms that I took the liberty to repurpose and redefine to be able to explain my meaning better.

Terms we use and define in next few chapters:

1. [Mindsets and "mindset statement"](../mindsets/term-mindset-and-mindset-statements-a-guiding-statement-for-behavior.md)
2. [Adopting a mindset](broken-reference)
3. [Being aware](../learn-a-new-language/being-aware-means-to-understand-our-momentous-internal-state.md)
4. [Feeling](../learn-a-new-language/term-feelings-are-whats-alive-inside-us.md)
5. [Need](../learn-a-new-language/term-needs-are-our-deepest-motivations-behind-anything-we-think-say-or-do.md)
6. [Observation](../learn-a-new-language/term-observation-is-something-we-can-record-on-camera-or-microphone-or-notice-of-ourselves.md)
