# Understanding the terms

Most people skim through terms and definitions.&#x20;

Don't.

Please don't.

If you do, you run the risk of misunderstanding the content, have it work differently or fail.

This toolkit uses very specific **terms** (or "words") that are defined, sometimes very differently than "common knowledge." Read carefully through the definition of terms - it will help convey the meaning of the tools better. I spent weeks and sometimes months refining a term based on people's feedback to help clarify concepts.

My mother, a teacher for the last 40 years says: "People really understand \<a subject> almost all by themselves when they have deep understanding of the terminology. Not just a short sentence of what a term means, but practice with examples, use the term, understand where and how the term applies and the gotchas."

Terms we use and define in next few chapters:

1. [Mindsets and "mindset statement"](../mindsets/term-mindset-statements.md)
2. [Adopting a mindset](broken-reference)
3. [Being aware](../learn-a-new-language/being-aware-means-to-understand-our-momentous-internal-state.md)
4. [Feeling](../learn-a-new-language/term-feelings-are-whats-alive-inside-us.md)
5. [Need](../learn-a-new-language/term-needs-are-our-deepest-motivations-behind-anything-we-think-say-or-do.md)
6. [Observation](../learn-a-new-language/term-observation-is-something-we-can-record-on-camera-or-microphone-or-notice-of-ourselves.md)
7. Requests and Demands
8. Interpretation, Evaluation, Assessment, Diagnosis, Judgement
