# Understanding the terms

Terms are very important here because I define some words differently than "common knowledge."

For example, I define emotions and feelings to mean very specific, different things in the context of this toolkit. This doesn't mean that my definition is correct and another incorrect. It just means I'm going to use these definitions to help me make the content of the book clearer.&#x20;

Most people skim through terms and definitions.&#x20;

I am hopeful that you won't.

If you do, you run the risk of misunderstanding the content, have it work differently or fail.

I spent weeks and sometimes months refining a term based on people's feedback to help clarify concepts.

My mother, a teacher of more than 40 years says: "People really understand a subject almost all by themselves when they have deep understanding of the terminology. Not just a short sentence of what a term means, but practice with examples, use the term, understand where and how the term applies and the gotchas."

Terms are indicated by text "Term:" in titles.
