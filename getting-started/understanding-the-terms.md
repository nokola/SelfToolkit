# Understanding the terms

Most people skim through terms and definitions.&#x20;

I am hopeful that you won't.

If you do, you run the risk of misunderstanding the content, have it work differently or fail.

This toolkit uses very specific **terms** (or "words") that are defined, sometimes very differently than "common knowledge." Read the terms definitions - it will help convey the meaning of the tools better. I spent weeks and sometimes months refining a term based on people's feedback to help clarify concepts.

My mother, a teacher of more than 40 years says: "People really understand a subject almost all by themselves when they have deep understanding of the terminology. Not just a short sentence of what a term means, but practice with examples, use the term, understand where and how the term applies and the gotchas."

Terms are indicated by text "Term:" in titles.
