How long does it take to learn self-awareness and communication?&#x20;

About 55 years, or some similar number.

Similarly, to other endeavors in life, self-awareness and communication is a process of life-long study.&#x20;

Throughout, I will improve and be more effective at understanding myself, understanding others, and conveying my meaning to others. Even when re-reading this, I may find something useful and immediately applicable.&#x20;

If you're still not convinced, this about this: "how long does it take to become a painter, doctor, software engineer, teacher, construction worker, gymnast?". While you may have proficiency in a specific area, you're likely to have more skill 1 year later, 5 years later, and so on. Practicing for multiple years builds skills. Whether it's one of the above professions or self-awareness and communication skills.
