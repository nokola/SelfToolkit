How long does it take to learn self-awareness and communication?&#x20;

About 55 years.

It's a process of life-long learning.

Throughout this journey, I decide to improve and be more effective at understanding myself, understanding others, and conveying my meaning to others. Even when re-reading this, I may find something useful and immediately applicable.&#x20;

If you're still not convinced, think about this: "how long does it take to become a painter, doctor, software engineer, teacher, construction worker, gymnast?".&#x20;

While you may have proficiency in a specific area, you're likely to improve in a year, in 5 years, and so on. Practice over multiple years builds skills.&#x20;

Whether it's a profession or self-awareness and communication skill.
