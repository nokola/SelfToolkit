How long does it take to learn self-awareness and communication?&#x20;

About 55 years, or some similar number.

Similarly, to other endeavors in life, self-awareness and communication is a process of life-long study.&#x20;

Throughout, you will improve and be more effective at understanding yourself, understanding others, and conveying your meaning to others. Even in the first day or minutes of reading this, you may find something useful and immediately applicable.&#x20;

If you're still not convinced consider "how long does it take to become a painter?" or "how long does it take to become a doctor, software engineer, teacher, construction worker, gymnast". While you may have proficiency in a specific area, you're likely to have more skill a year later, 5 years later after practicing even if you practiced for multiple years already. Self-awareness and communication is similar.
