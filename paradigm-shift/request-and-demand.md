# âš’ Request and demand

Request: TODO



Who decides whether something is a request or demand?

The _sender_ decides whether they meant something as a request.

The _receiver_ decides whether they received something as a request.

If you catch yourself in an argument like this:

A: What you said is a demand!

You: No, it's a request!



Step back and realize: what you said is being received as demand. You meant it as request.
