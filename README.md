# Welcome

This is _Self-Awareness and Communication Toolkit_, a living book exploring the science of communication by introducing a number of tools to help understand ourselves and others better and communicate more clearly. Awareness helps you improve your wellbeing, enjoy deeper relationships with others and yourself, and build resilience when faced with challenges in your daily life.

## Free Toolkit

This toolkit is free; however you can [support me on ♥ Patreon](https://patreon.com/nokola) to get some extras like one-off articles on widely discussed subjects, continue expanding the list of tools, get sneak peek to and influence new development.

Link others to this page directly, so that they have the latest version with all the edits and fixes.

If you'd like to support the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this, buy their books from the Prior Works section. I'm not affiliated in any way.

## Collaborative Toolkit

I'd like to manage this as a collaborative project that's alive with frequent updates, changes, and improvements from all our readers and contributors rather than "a book". Over the years I found that collaborative knowledge can far exceed any single person's contribution. I'd like to hear your opinions through Patreon.

## Connection Science is at a Very Early Stage

For as long as humanity existed, people practiced various methods of connecting with others and with themselves. Often these ways would end up at odds with one another. From shamanism, religion, tribal groups, through daily interaction at work and at home, to war, we attempt to express ourselves and achieve what we need and want in myriad of ways.

Thank you, Rascal. For everyone reading so far, Rascal is our resident chill racoon who will help us understand some of the concepts and challenge me, the author, from time to time.

> :raccoon: You can call me Ras if you'd like.

Sounds good, Ras!

There are multiple studies in communication, psychology books, workshops and methods. Unlike math, physics and other sciences a lot of information con connection and communication exists in silos loosely referencing one another.&#x20;

This book does not aim (but it might happen) to fail miserably and result in yet-another-teaching-workshop-or-writing. This book is an attempt to combine a few sources into something more cohesive that is useful to others.&#x20;

> :raccoon:A science, of sorts.

Of sorts.

## Understanding ourselves and others can help us live a better life

What happens then, Ras, when you feel angry, or sad without realizing?

&#x20;It's usually because someone **made me** __ <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.

Hmm...do you mean like yesterday when I told you I can't come to the trash can for our daily 4 PM rummage because I was writing this book?

> :raccoon: Yes, that made me <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>, yes. Now you get it. You did it, 100%. You.

Last week I told you I can't come to the trash can for our 4 PM. You had huge piece of ham you were looking forward to eating (all by yourself I might add.) How did you feel then?

> :raccoon: I was pretty <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about that ham.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note to reader: I gave Ras the ham.
{% endhint %}

Both times I said the same thing...that I can't make it. But the first time you were <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about it, and the second time you were <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.&#x20;

How could I have made you sad or happy - both times I said the same thing! Did \*I\* really made you feel sad \*and\* __ happy by doing the exact same thing?

> :raccoon: I guess you did...and you didn't?

In the Science of Connection and awareness I'd say:

* **I contributed to an environment to trigger an \*emotion\* that you \*felt\* a certain way.**&#x20;

and&#x20;

* **You \*felt\* a certain way based on your past lived experience, current state, and how you subconsciously and consciously interpreted the \*emotion\***

Both of these are true. I didn't make you feel a certain way, neither did you.

We both did!

> ​:raccoon: Ha! Hmm, I think I may get what you're saying...but I thought emotions and feelings are the same thing? And what is with these \*asterisks\* and <mark style="color:orange;">colors</mark> that we're now using? Are you just trying to be fancy?

I use asterisks to identify terms like \*feelings\* or \*needs\*. Terms are very important here because I define some words differently.&#x20;

For example, I define \*emotions\* and \*feelings\* to mean very specific, different things in the context of this book. This doesn't mean that one definition is correct and another incorrect. It just means I'm going to use these definitions to help me make the content of the book clearer.

Orange is used for feelings (like <mark style="color:orange;">joy</mark>) <mark style="color:orange;"></mark> and blue is used for needs (like <mark style="color:blue;">food</mark>).
