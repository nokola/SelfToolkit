# Welcome

Have you ever doubted yourself? Thinking "am I too much", "am I right", worrying about the future, or ruminating over the past long or short gone?

Take a few moments and think about your relationship with any of the following thoughts.

How related to you it is, what influence might it have over your life? When do you feel it? What do you do or say when you experience it?

* An inner voice that tells you that nothing will change regardless of how hard you try?
* An inner voice that tells you are not good/smart/useful enough?
* That you're not working hard enough, or are lazy?
* A creeping sense of worthlessness that you sometimes notice on the back of your head
* That you have to care for everyone else
* To constantly check your messages
* A need for intimacy and friendship
* Sensitive feelings that can easily be hurt
* Need to be in control of everyone or everything
* Comparing with others and feeling upset when they are better
* Hiding and avoiding showing any mistake
* Afraid what saying something in front of one or many others might do
* A happy mask that hide your true emotions
* Urge to binge on food, tv, porn, or other consumer media
* Judgmental thoughts you have about others
* Dissatisfaction with work, the economy, the world, or anything else

If you're like me, you likely experienced some of them recently, and some a just "hiding" on the back of your mind, waiting to show up.

For 15 years I suffered with anxiety, frustrations, misunderstandings and generally missing on life. And I didn't even know. I went through an abusive relationship where I felt horrible. I was an enabler. I was clinging to ideas and societal expectations. I read countless articles, self-help, and went to different psychologists a couple of times.

And then without realizing, things started to change. One day at work I got a call from a distressed co-worker at 10 AM in the morning. The person mentioned that "they no longer want to work with X" because "I can't. I'm going to talk with my boss to take me off the project". The call went on for two hours listening to this person's pain and problems with another coworker. I knew both. I was a third party. They both wanted the best. "Why wouldn't they work with each other?" I thought.

This is when I decided to start a club. I called it Brave Conversations, and it was initially just for Microsoft employees. Over the next 3 years Brave Conversations flourished. With the help interested coworkers we presented 37 workshops at Microsoft. I ran more than 30 experiments and reached hundreds of people. In few cases, we supported coworkers through very personal, hard, nerve-wracking situations.

Most of the time, folks care about changing their life for the better in small ways. Sometimes they didn't even notice a problem even if it is affecting them.

I spent countless hours on my own and with others decoupling the intricacies of communication and self-work like self-acceptance, self-awareness, self-love. Along the way my outlook changed, my thinking patterns improved, my anxiety mostly went away. The remaining anxiety, I enjoy. I see it as a way for my brain to protect myself. Will write about this more.

I managed to deal with some moments that would otherwise be extremely difficult, navigate personal subjects with ease. No longer I think that I want to disappear. And really **enjoy** and **feel alive**, not just living.

What I'm going to present here are concepts and tools that worked for me and others. I hope they work for you. And if they don't, I hope that you would let me know so that I can avoid spewing bullshit that doesn't work.

## Rascal

Meet Rascal, our resident racoon who will help us understand some of the concepts and challenge me, the author, from time to time.

Hi, Ras!

## Understanding ourselves and others can help us live a better life

> :raccoon: I understand myself. I talk with others daily and I'm feeling pretty good right now! I can communicate already! Why would I need any of your ramblings?

Ras, have you ever felt angry, or sad without realizing?

> :raccoon: It's usually because someone **made me** <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.

Hmm...like yesterday? When I told you I can't come to the trash can for our daily 4 PM rummage because I was writing here?

> :raccoon: Yes, that made me <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>, yes. Now you get it. You did it, 100%. You.

Last week I told you I can't come to the trash can for our 4 PM. You had huge piece of ham you were looking forward to eating (all by yourself I might add.) How did you feel then?

> :raccoon: I was pretty <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about that ham.

Both times I said the same thing...that "I can't make it". But the first time you were <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about it, and the second time you were <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.&#x20;

How could \*I\* have made you sad or happy each time, when I said the same thing! Did I really made you feel sad and happy by doing the exact same thing?

> :raccoon: I guess you did...and you didn't?

Perhaps this happened:

* **I contributed to an environment to trigger an emotion that you felt a certain way.**&#x20;

and&#x20;

* **You felt a certain way based on your past lived experiences, current state, and how you subconsciously and consciously interpreted the emotion**

Both of these are true. I didn't 100% make you feel a certain way, neither did you.

We both did!

> ​:raccoon: But mostly you did it.
