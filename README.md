# Welcome

This is _(Self-) Awareness and Communication Toolkit_, a book exploring the science of communication by introducing a number of tools to help understand ourselves and others better and communicate more clearly. Awareness helps you improve your wellbeing, enjoy deeper relationships with others and yourself, and build resilience when faced with challenges in your daily life.

## This is a free toolkit

Link others to this page directly, so that they have the latest version with all the edits and fixes.

If you'd like to support the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this, buy their books from the Prior Works section (we're not affiliated in any way).

I ask that you [support me on ♥ Patreon](https://patreon.com/nokola) to continue expanding the list of tools, get sneak peek and influence new development.

## This is a collaborative toolkit

I'd like to manage this as a collaborative project that's alive with frequent updates, changes, and improvements from all our readers and contributors rather than "a book". Over the years I found that collaborative knowledge can far exceed any single person's contribution. I'd like to hear your opinions through Patreon.

## Connection science is at a very early stage

For as long as humanity existed, people practiced various methods of connecting with others and with themselves. Often these ways would end up at odds with one another. From shamanism, religion, tribal groups, through daily interaction at work and at home, to war, we attempt to express ourselves and achieve what we need and want in myriad of ways.

There are multiple studies in communication, psychology books, workshops and methods, however unlike other sciences like physics, mathematics, or biology, a lot of the ways for connecting exist in siloes or loosely referencing one another. This book is an attempt to combine a few sources into something more cohesive that is useful to others. This book does not aim (but it might happen) to fail miserably and result in yet-another-teaching-workshop-or-writing.

## Understanding ourselves and others can help us live a better life

:raccoon: Chill Raccoon's soul-searching comment:

I understand myself. I talk with others daily and I'm feeling pretty good right now! I can communicate already! Why would I need any of your ramblings or your book?
{% endhint %}

What happens then, Raccoon, when you feel angry, or sad without realizing?

Hmm...do you mean like yesterday when I told you I can't come to the trash can for our daily 4 PM rummage because I was writing this book?

Do you remember last week - I told you I can't come to the trash can for our 4 PM. There was this huge piece of ham you were looking forward to eating (all by yourself I might add.) How did you feel then?

{% hint style="info" %}
Note to reader: I was me who tossed the ham in there.
{% endhint %}

Both times I said the same thing...that I can't make it. But the first time you were <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about it, and the second time you were <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.&#x20;

How could I have made you sad or happy - both times I said the same thing! Did _I_ really made you feel sad _and_ happy by doing the exact same thing?

In the Science of Connection and awareness I'd say:

* **I contributed to an environment where you felt a certain way**&#x20;

and&#x20;

* **You felt a certain way based on your past lived experience and current state.**

Both of these are true. I didn't make you feel a certain way, neither did you.
