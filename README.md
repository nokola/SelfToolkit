# Acknowledgements

I want to thank myself, because without myself this book on self-love, self-care, and self-acceptance wouldn't be possible.

Also huge thanks to all fellow traumatized folks on r/emotionalabuse subreddit for being supportive of each other, sharing and listening to examples, all the book authors that helped me get here, friends, family, and wild animals.&#x20;

I hope you will experience a wild and enjoyable ride in life and this book will be a little guide for part of it.
