# Welcome

If you're like me, you've doubted yourself. Maybe you thought "am I too much", "am I right", worried about the future, or ruminated over the past.

Take a few moments and think about your relationship with any of the following thoughts.

How related to you it is and what influence might it have over your life?&#x20;

When do you feel it?&#x20;

What do you do or say when you experience it?

* An inner voice that tells you that nothing will change regardless of how hard you try
* An inner voice that tells you are not good/smart/useful enough
* That you're not working hard enough, or are lazy
* A creeping sense of worthlessness that you sometimes notice on the back of your head
* That you have to care for someone or everyone else
* To constantly check your messages
* A need for intimacy and friendship
* Sensitive feelings that can easily be hurt
* Need to be in control of everyone or everything
* Comparing with others and feeling upset when they are better
* Hiding and avoiding showing any mistake
* Afraid what saying something in front of others
* A happy mask that hide your true emotions
* Urge to binge on food, tv, porn, or other consumer media
* Judgmental thoughts you have about others
* Dissatisfaction with work, the economy, the world, or anything else

For 15 years I suffered with anxiety, frustrations, misunderstandings and generally missing on life. And I didn't even know. I went through an abusive relationship where I felt horrible. I was an enabler. I was clinging to ideas and societal expectations.&#x20;

I read countless articles, self-help, and went to different psychologists a couple of times. I though I knew it all, and that I understand things.

One morning at work, I received an urgent call from a colleague in distress. "I no longer want to work with X" they said "because I can't. I'm going to talk with my boss to take me off the project". I listened to their struggles and issues with the other coworker, I was baffled, somewhat uncomfortable, and grateful that they picked me to share the information with. I knew both people and I knew they both wanted the best. I pondered over their shared goals for success and wondered why collaboration was failing.

This incident sparked the idea for "Brave Conversations," a club initially aimed at Microsoft employees. Over three years, the club thrived. Along with enthusiastic colleagues, we hosted 37 workshops within Microsoft, conducted over 30 experimental sessions, and impacted hundreds of individuals. Our efforts even extended to assisting coworkers in navigating exceptionally personal and challenging situations.

Most of the time, folks care about changing their life for the better in small ways. Sometimes they didn't even notice a problem even if it is affecting them.

I spent countless hours on my own and with others decoupling the intricacies of communication and self-work like self-acceptance, self-awareness, self-love. Along the way my outlook changed, my thinking patterns improved, my anxiety mostly went away. The remaining anxiety, I enjoy. I see it as a way for my brain to protect myself.

I managed to deal with some moments that would otherwise be extremely difficult, navigate personal subjects with ease. I began thinking that I want to appear, no longer I thought I wanted to disappear. And really **enjoy** and **feel alive**, not just living.

What I'm going to present here are concepts and tools that worked for me and others. I hope they work for you. And if they don't, I hope that you would let me know so that I can avoid spewing bullshit that doesn't work.

## Rascal

Meet Rascal, our resident racoon who will help us understand some of the concepts and challenge me, the author, from time to time.

> :raccoon: Hi! I'm Ras, the racoon. I ate the paper version of this book. You have to publish online now.

Hi, Ras!

## Understanding ourselves and others can help us live a better life

> :raccoon: I understand myself. I talk with others daily and I'm feeling pretty good right now! I can communicate already! Why would I need any of your ramblings?

Ras, have you ever felt angry, or sad without realizing?

> :raccoon: It's usually because someone **made me** <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.

Hmm...like yesterday? When I told you I can't come to the trash can for our daily 4 PM rummage because I was writing here?

> :raccoon: Yes, that made me <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>, yes. Now you get it. You did it, 100%. You.

Last week I told you I can't come to the trash can for our 4 PM. You had huge piece of ham you were looking forward to eating (all by yourself I might add.) How did you feel then?

> :raccoon: I was pretty <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about that ham.

Both times I said the same thing...that "I can't make it". But the first time you were <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about it, and the second time you were <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.&#x20;

How could \*I\* have made you sad or happy each time, when I said the same thing! Did I really made you feel sad and happy by doing the exact same thing?

> :raccoon: I guess you did...and you didn't?

Perhaps this happened:

* **I contributed to an environment to trigger an emotion that you felt a certain way.**&#x20;

and&#x20;

* **You felt a certain way based on your past lived experiences, current state, and how you subconsciously and consciously interpreted the emotion**

Both of these are true. I didn't 100% make you feel a certain way, neither did you.

We both did!

> â€‹:raccoon: But mostly you did it.
