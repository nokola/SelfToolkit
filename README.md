# Welcome

For 15 years I suffered with anxiety, frustrations, misunderstandings and generally missing on life. And I didn't even know. I went through an abusive relationship where I felt horrible. I was an enabler. I was clinging to ideas and societal expectations. I read countless articles, self-help, and went to different psychologists a couple of times.

And then without realizing, things started to change. One day at work I got a call from a distressed co-worker at 10 AM in the morning. The person mentioned that "they no longer want to work with X" because "I can't" and "I'm going to talk with my boss to take me off the project". The call went on for about 2 hours listening to this person's pain and problems with X. I knew both. I was a third party. They both wanted the best. "Why wouldn't they work with each other?" I thought.

This is when I decided to start a club. I called it Brave Conversations, and it was initially just for Microsoft employees. Over the next 3 years Brave Conversations flourished. With the help of numerous coworkers presented 37 workshops at Microsoft. I ran 30 or so experiments and reached hundreds of people. In few cases, we supported coworkers through very personal, hard, nerve-wracking situations. Sad, depressing, _horrible_ places.

Not everyone was like that. Most of the time, folks care about changing their life for the better in small ways. Sometimes they didn't even notice a problem even if it is affecting them. I learned that folks want to improve their decision making, wellbeing, talking with others (spouses, friends, coworkers.) Meeting needs.

I spent countless hours on my own and with others decoupling the intricacies of communication and self-work like self-acceptance, self-awareness, self-love. Along the way my thinking changed, my thinking patterns improved, my anxiety mostly went away. The remaining anxiety is useful, and I love it! Enjoying my anxiety - imagine that! Our learnings and workshops changed behaviors and improved wellbeing.

I managed to deal with some moments that would otherwise be insanely hard, navigate personal and self-related subjects with ease. No longer I think that I want to disappear. And really **enjoy** and **feel alive**, not just living.

I still fall in traps. If I can apply the tools from this toolkit 3-10% of the time, I'm happy.

If you have ever wondered "what does it mean to communicate better?" or "how can I improve my wellbeing" this toolkit might be for you.

What I'm going to present here are concepts and tools that worked for me and others. I hope they work for you, whoever you are. And if they don't, I hope that you would let me know so that I can avoid spewing bullshit that doesn't work online. Anything that I misrepresented is my mistake.

This is _Self-Awareness and Communication Toolkit_, a living book exploring the science of communication by introducing a number of thinking and behavior tools to help understand ourselves and others better and communicate more clearly. Awareness helps you improve your wellbeing, enjoy deeper relationships with others and yourself. You will build resilience when faced with challenges in your daily life.

## Free

This toolkit is free. You can [support me on ♥ Patreon](https://patreon.com/nokola) to get some extras like articles and deeper dives on controversial subjects. Things like funding or defunding the police and religion and how it relates to communication. You can help me continue expanding the list of tools, get early content, and influence new development.

Link others to [https://strongenoughtobegentle.com](https://strongenoughtobegentle.com), so that they have the latest version with all the edits and fixes.

If you'd like to support the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this, buy their books from the References section. I'm not affiliated in any way.

## Collaborative

I'd like to manage this as a collaborative project that's **alive with frequent updates**, changes, and improvements from all our readers and contributors rather than "a book". Over the years I found that collaborative knowledge can far exceed any single person's contribution. I'd like to hear your opinions through Patreon.

## Connection science is not a science, yet

People practice various methods of connecting with others and with themselves. Often these ways would end up at odds with one another. We, the humans, tried multiple solutions. Shamanism, religion, tribal groups, daily interaction at work and at home, to war, we attempt to express ourselves and achieve what we need and want in myriad of ways.

Online articles on communication are usually what I call "pop culture" - a list or a slice of advice, some boxes to check and couple things to verify "if you're this or that". The information is not structured enough for my liking and sometimes hard to follow. Kind of like the top summer songs - they change often, each of them has something nice, but in the end they are separate. I call that pop culture. Songs don't really build upon each other the same way math papers and findings or chemistry does.

What I understand to be "science":

1. Builds upon prior work.
2. Makes things structured and systemic.
3. Grounded in experimentation and clarity.

Above all, mostly **works.**

There are multiple studies in communication - psychology books, workshops, and methods.&#x20;

Unlike sciences a lot of information on connection and communication exists in silos loosely referencing one another.

Let's see if we can change that. This toolkit contains references to 20 or so sources. Things that worked. Showing and explaining awareness and communication tools that I tested and found others report useful, through research and experimentation.

## Rascal

Meet Rascal, our resident racoon who will help us understand some of the concepts and challenge me, the author, from time to time.

> :raccoon: Hi! I'm Ras, the racoon. I ate the paper version of this book. You have to publish online now.

Hi, Ras!

## Understanding ourselves and others can help us live a better life

> :raccoon: I understand myself. I talk with others daily and I'm feeling pretty good right now! I can communicate already! Why would I need any of your ramblings?

Ras, have you ever felt angry, or sad without realizing?

> :raccoon: It's usually because someone **made me** <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.

Hmm...like yesterday? When I told you I can't come to the trash can for our daily 4 PM rummage because I was writing here?

> :raccoon: Yes, that made me <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>, yes. Now you get it. You did it, 100%. You.

Last week I told you I can't come to the trash can for our 4 PM. You had huge piece of ham you were looking forward to eating (all by yourself I might add.) How did you feel then?

> :raccoon: I was pretty <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about that ham.

Both times I said the same thing...that "I can't make it". But the first time you were <mark style="color:orange;">happy</mark> about it, and the second time you were <mark style="color:orange;">sad</mark>.&#x20;

How could \*I\* have made you sad or happy each time, when I said the same thing! Did I really made you feel sad and happy by doing the exact same thing?

> :raccoon: I guess you did...and you didn't?

Perhaps this happened:

* **I contributed to an environment to trigger an emotion that you felt a certain way.**&#x20;

and&#x20;

* **You felt a certain way based on your past lived experiences, current state, and how you subconsciously and consciously interpreted the emotion**

Both of these are true. I didn't 100% make you feel a certain way, neither did you.

We both did!

> ​:raccoon: But mostly you did it.
