# Gasligthing

Gaslighting is when someone intentionally or unintentionally attempts to twist your perception of reality for their own gain.

What does it look like?

1. "You're overreacting"
2. "You're too sensitive".
3. "You shoved me" when you only touched the person, or "you did X". Note: Evaluations such as "You don't care" are potential misunderstanding, not necessarily gaslightning. Could be gaslighting though - check.
4. "You need help" and its derivatives "You're crazy"
5. "I never said that".
6. "Just calm down" or "Why are you upset again?"

## How to respond to gaslighting?

1. Start the response by thinking - realize that what you hear is different than what people said. See [i-heard-rather-than-you-said.md](i-heard-rather-than-you-said.md "mention")
2. Realize the following:
   1. It's Ok to be as sensitive as you are. "Too sensitive" is an evaluation, and thus subjective. Who decides how sensitive is too sensitive? Deconstruct. See [deconstructing.md](../paradigm-shift/deconstructing.md "mention")
   2. You may not get closure or resolution from the other person. Thus, your closure may be realizing that the other person chooses (consciously or subconsciously) to engage with you in the way they do.
   3. Any feeling is OK
3. Realize your truth&#x20;
   1. What you believe is true may be different than what someone else's version. Or they may be intentionally misrepresenting.
   2. Don't look for what's an excuse or not excuse - focus on how you feel, what your needs are and strategies to meet them.
   3. You can choose to respond by protecting yourself. That may look like reducing contact with the person, reducing interactions that involve trust (such as not asking them for favors) or keeping in mind that similar situations may arise in the future, or doing something else.
   4. Use "I" statements e.g. "I heard xyz" "I thought xyz". If met with "No I never said or did that" respond by - "Maybe you didn't. I'm only talking about what I heard and how I feel". Don't argue what is "truth" - just focus on clarity of message - what is your truth, and what is their truth. They can be different or incompatible.
   5. Ask: "What would I like to do now?", ask others: "What would you like to do now?"
