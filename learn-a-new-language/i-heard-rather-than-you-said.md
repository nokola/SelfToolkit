# âš’ "I heard" rather than "you said"

A: You said you'll come at 8 PM!

B: No, I said 8-9.

A: No, you said 8. You always do this.

From now on, don't argue what people said. Only explain what you heard and accept what they think they said as their truth and opinion.

Here's the same conversation but A is now explaining their viewpoint more clearly:

A: I heard you'll come at 8 PM!

B: No, I said 8-9.

A: I understand, I'm not arguing about what you said. Maybe you did say 8-9. I'm just mentioning that I heard 8 PM.

B: I said 8-9!

A: Yes, that's totally possible. I'm not arguing about what you said. Just explaining what I heard. What could we do from here?

## **ðŸ”§Tool: "I heard"**

Never argue about what someone else said, or did, or didn't do. Only try to understand their viewpoint and explain your viewpoint - what you heard, deconstructed (see [deconstructing.md](../paradigm-shift/deconstructing.md "mention")), interpreted.
