# Monkey scripts

A: Where do you want to go for lunch?

B: I'm not sure, you?

A: I'm OK with anything. How about you pick?

B: Mexican?

A: Sounds good.

What we just saw above is an example of Monkey script - automatic social glue, subconsciously driven by Monkey brain. If examined, some scripts are useful, while others are not. Think patterns of abusive behavior or enabling abusive behavior.

Realizing **consciously** whether your brain is running a script can improve your wellbeing. It will provide you with the ability to engage your Human brain and options to choose what to do (rather than Monkey only choosing subconsciously.)
