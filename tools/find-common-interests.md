# Find common interests

Anything common interest that you can discuss between you and someone else will make it easier to discuss less conflicting positions or beliefs later.&#x20;

For example, discussing soccer or birds may help discuss funding or defunding the police. Discussing a common interest helps in two ways. First, it helps model calm behavior and disagreeing on a safer topic. Second, it helps have a calm experience that our brain may go to when discussing a less comfortable topic.

Discussing common interests and topics can be used as a stepping stone to discussing less common interests and topics.&#x20;
